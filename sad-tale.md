House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

I've never watched Game of Thrones, but I hear Ned was a pretty good guy. It's unfortunate that he was axe-murdered. If only he won the battle and went on to live a happy life involving puppies and Disney World.
